# Hardingreen

This game was created for the Bahia Game Jam 2020. 
We only had 48hs to work on it. It's completelly created with javascript.

It uses React together with react-three-fiber for the rendering, and matter-js as a physics engine.

Since we actually only used 30hs of the 48hs there were a little bit of shortcuts on the design of the code.
